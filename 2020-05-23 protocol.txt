What we did today:

- Iskra uploaded a first dataset in the group folder. the sources will be documented here: https://github.com/KevinGuu/ML-in-MIP/wiki/Datasets
- we use github from now on and run the notebooks not in the group folder, but in our private one
- we set up a Keras kernel that uses the GPU in our private folder on the server
- Martin explained the notebook "main" to us that trained three models on some pneumonia vs normal data: VGG16, ResNet152 and DenseNet201_model_wo_top

- we trained vgg16 on the 200 first images of each class in our current dataset. we tested on two images and the label prediction was correct


stuff we want to alter after the first test run:

- instead of using 224*224 size images, use bigger ones
- modify explain prediction function to pick images with specific labels
- implement the script that blacks out the middle to see if pathology features were learned
