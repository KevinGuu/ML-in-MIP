what we want to do until/in the next meeting:

- get tensorflow gpu version installed (martin)

- which image input size is best? some paper had better results with 4xx pixels instead of 224. maybe find paper that said that was better (andre)

- look at datasets to be able to decide for a first dataset we wanna train on. there is a list in the first lecture. martin said there is also a post in the forum about datasets, that might be worth checking out. i also found this list of datasets, probably some but not all may be interesting for us: https://www.researchgate.net/post/updated_list_Last_updated_May_10th_2020_of_Coronavirus_Covid-19_dataset_and_other_Research_Resources
rough points which interest in the datasets are:
	how many images are there?
	what classes are tagged?
	are there already reviews about this dataset?

- look at different pretrained keras models to be able to decide which one we could use as a starting point: https://keras.io/api/applications/

- think about what classes we actually would like to classify (see: datasets)

next week then we wanna do a first test run. that means, train one of the models keras already provides on one of the medical image datasets and see how that performs as a baseline.
